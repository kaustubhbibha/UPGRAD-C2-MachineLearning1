## General Information
- The goal of the project is to find the variables that have the highest impact on the number of Bike Rentals.
- The project makes use of regression analysis and EDA to find out most impactful features.
- The business problem to solve is predicting the demand for the clients product(rental bikes) at any given day.
- The client has provided daily rental data along with calendar, weather variables for this project.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The apparent temperature(**atemp**) has the highest impact on the demand of the clients product.
- **atemp**: an increase leads to increase in the number of bikes rented. POSITIVE CORRELATION
- People rent more bikes in winter and fewer bikes in summer
- The average number of bikes rented has increased significantly from 2018 to 2019.
